Park yourself at 45 The Parkway.\"\r\n\r\nI apologise for the cringe heading - but this property has so much going for it. \r\nAs I mentioned, it's opposite sprawling parkland and walking distance to the iconic Lakeside Lake. It's also walking distance to shops, schools and Cardinia Train Station. It's the reason why the Lakeside Estate is one of Pakenham's preferred locations. \r\n\r\nBuyers always wanting parking options. You've got it here. \r\nA double car garage, plus ginormous side access allowing for additional car spaces. On top of this you've got a large driveway and with no neighbours over the road you will never have to worry about a congested street full of parked cars. \r\n\r\nBut let's talk about the home:\r\n- Three bedrooms, master with en-suite and walk-in robe;\r\n- Large formal living area at the front of the home;\r\n- Expansive living/dining room adjacent to the modern kitchen;\r\n- Ducted heating and evaporative cooling;\r\n- Recently painted;\r\n- New carpets and tiled flooring has been regrouted throughout. \r\n\r\nOutside the property comes to life;\r\n- Under roofline alfresco;\r\n- Large decked area that sprawls from under the alfresco and ushers you out to the backyard;\r\n- Ambient fire pit;\r\n- Plenty of yard space;\r\n- Block size of 640sqm.\r\n\r\nMake sure this is on your shortlist of viewings this week. \r\n"

      "description": "Sitting on a large 1012 sqm block this large 4 bedroom/ two bathroom home has a lot to offer.\n\nThe kitchen was recently replaced and would have cost a pretty penny with its composite benchtops, massive drawer storage, and stainless steel appliances. The beautiful Johnstone River hardwood floors were resanded and polished and have come up beautifully. They will probably last another 40 years. The main bathroom is modern and bright with its large walk-in shower. The deck off the kitchen/ dining area is undercover and commands excellent views towards Coquette Point and over the pool. This is the perfect place for entertaining or a quiet breakfast. I think you would probably enjoy all of your meals out here.\n\nThe bedrooms are all a good size, there is air conditioning throughout and there is even a self-contained guest bedroom with its bathroom and kitchenette downstairs. Also downstairs is a very large double garage space, with double depth and a huge workshop space attached. This is also where you find the pool deck and the built-in BBQ area, along with the large pool and even an additional shed out the back. \n\nThe house has had plenty of money spent on it with lots of new fans and light fittings, some upgraded air conditioners, and some fresh paint. There is not a cent to spend on it now. It is a combination of the generous proportions of the 80s along with the modern and stylish trends of today.\n\nThis is a wonderful family home.\n\nContact Michael Skuse"

A tranquil escape to your own private paradise, it is perfectly designed for rest and relaxation, a place where family and friends can come together.  \n\nAs you step inside the entry arbor gate, a lush tropical front garden welcomes you.  Beautifully landscaped with timber walkways, stepping-stone pavers and spots to stop, sit and admire your private gardens, prepare to fall in love before you even enter this magical home.\n\nStepping through the blue front door, you are greeted by soaring cathedral ceilings and an ingenious use of glass that captures the tranquil bushland views, casting an open, airy ambience throughout the home. Here, an unparalleled sense of space takes shape, owing to the open warehouse-style layout, ultra-chic feel and resort-style ambience. \n\nAn expansive and continuous living, dining and kitchen space fills the main level of the home, creating the perfect atmosphere for intimate home life and entertaining the largest of crowds. A striking feature wall, crafted by a talented German master painter, stretches from floor to ceiling, adding impact to the space.  A stunning combustion fireplace is a more recent addition, keeping the home warm in the winter months.  \n\nThe entire main level flows seamlessly out to the generously sized decks. Wrapping around the home, the decks provide the perfect vantage point to soak in the sights and sounds of Australia's iconic bushland. Cafe blinds allow the space to be fully open or sectioned off to create a cosy sunroom. \n\nThe entry mezzanine level flows either side to all three bedrooms, with a separate study. Step up a split level to discover your private master retreat, complete with a full wall of built-ins and a stunning, renovated ensuite with black soaker tub.  Your private deck provides the ideal spot to unwind and soak in the bushland views.\n\nThe home features a total of two beautifully renovated bathrooms (two soaker tubs!)  plus a powder room and third toilet room.\n\nA modern, vibrant kitchen sets the scene for culinary exploration!  It is sure to inspire even the most amateur of cooks with its fun, colourful bursts in the cabinetry and, if colour is not your thing, the cabinets can easily be sprayed. The superbly appointed kitchen offers a full range of quality appliances including two gas ovens, dishwasher, double gas cooktop, and large walk-in pantry.\nOutdoors, you can seek rest and relaxation on the expansive decks or enjoy a dip in the pool/spa. Relax poolside in the new gazebo or perch at the bar area with a drink.  \n\nYour fully-fenced, bushland backyard has been neatly landscaped with an array of plants and fruit trees.  A chicken coup is a bonus (or handy extra storage area).\nRest easy, knowing your vehicles are safe and secure in the double lock-up garage complete with electric garage door and additional storage areas. \n\nOther quality features include:\nSolar heart gas water, Solar panels (7 kw), quality built-in cabinetry in the main living zone, new ceiling fans and blinds throughout the home, security screens, new outdoor spotlights, front driveway has been re-sealed and re-painted.\n\nDiscover the convenience of living in such a prime position within minutes to the Logan Hyperdome, cafes, restaurants, public transport and easy access to the M1 leading to the Gold Coast and Brisbane CBD.

Timber bi-fold doors open wide to seamlessly blend indoors and out, with cafe blinds, heating, ceiling fan, surround sound, built-in Beefeater BBQ with rangehood, and a wine fridge making it the perfect space to relax and entertain.\nAll four bedrooms are carpeted with built-in robes and ceiling fans, the master enjoying the addition of a walk-in robe and private ensuite. The fully updated main bathroom services the home along with a separate powder room and ample laundry, and there's a separate study/home office with built-in desk providing the perfect work from home setup.\nLandscaped gardens provide privacy for the large backyard that enjoys sweeping views over the valley from it's elevated position, and are looked after by an automated sprinkler system. A paved fire pit and garden lighting ensure plenty of enjoyment.\nDucted heating, evaporative cooling, carport, plus additional parking space in front, and a large Colorbond shed with 10- and 15-amp power complete this brilliant package, catering to every member of the family. Positioned in arguably one of Glenroy's favourite neighbourhoods, the home is less than a 10 minute walk from both Penola College and Glenroy West Primary. Shopping and public transport are all conveniently nearby, and Kingsford Smith Ulm Reserve and playground are right over your back fence."
